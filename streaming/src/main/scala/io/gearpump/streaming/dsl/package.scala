/**
 *
 * The architecture of Gearpump Streaming DSL consists of several layers:
 *
 *   * User facing [[Stream]] DSL. Stream is created by [[io.gearpump.streaming.dsl.scalaapi.StreamApp]]
 *     from input source like Kafka or by applying high level operations (e.g. flatMap, window, groupBy) to user defined functions(UDFs). UDFs are subclasses
 *     of [[io.gearpump.streaming.dsl.api.functions.SerializableFunction]], represented by [[io.gearpump.streaming.dsl.plan.Op]]
 *     in the underlying [[io.gearpump.util.Graph]].
 *   * [[io.gearpump.streaming.dsl.plan.Planner]], responsible for interpreting the Op Graph, optimizing it and building a low level Graph of
 *     [[io.gearpump.streaming.Processor]]. Finally, it creates a runnable Graph of [[io.gearpump.streaming.task.Task]].
 *   * The execution layer is usually composed of the following four tasks.
 *
 *     * [[io.gearpump.streaming.source.DataSourceTask]] for [[io.gearpump.streaming.source.DataSource]] to ingest data into Gearpump
 *     * [[io.gearpump.streaming.sink.DataSinkTask]] for [[io.gearpump.streaming.sink.DataSink]] to write data out.
 *     * [[io.gearpump.streaming.dsl.task.GroupByTask]] to execute Ops followed by [[io.gearpump.streaming.dsl.plan.GroupByOp]]
 *     * [[io.gearpump.streaming.dsl.task.TransformTask]] to execute all other Ops.
 *
 *     All but [[sink.DataSinkTask]] delegates execution to [[io.gearpump.streaming.dsl.window.impl.StreamingOperator]], which internally
 *     runs a chain of [[io.gearpump.streaming.dsl.plan.functions.FunctionRunner]] grouped by windows. Window assignments are either explicitly defined with
 *     [[io.gearpump.streaming.dsl.window.api.Windows]] API or implicitly in [[io.gearpump.streaming.dsl.window.api.GlobalWindows]]. UDFs are eventually
 *     executed by [[io.gearpump.streaming.dsl.plan.functions.FunctionRunner]].
