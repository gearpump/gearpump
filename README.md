## GearPump [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/intel-hadoop/gearpump.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/intel-hadoop/gearpump?branch=master) [![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/intel-hadoop/gearpump/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/intel-hadoop/gearpump?branch=master)
 
GearPump is a lightweight real-time big data streaming engine. It is inspired by recent advances in the [Akka](https://github.com/akka/akka) framework and a desire to improve on existing streaming frameworks.

The	name	GearPump	is	a	reference to	the	engineering term “gear	pump,”	which	is	a	super simple
pump	that	consists of	only	two	gears,	but	is	very	powerful at	streaming water.

We model streaming within the Akka actor hierarchy.

Per initial benchmarks we are able to process 11 million messages/second (100 bytes per message) with a 17ms latency on a 4-node cluster.

There is a 20 pages technical paper on typesafe blog, with technical highlights https://typesafe.com/blog/gearpump-real-time-streaming-engine-using-akka


## Getting Started: WordCount

1. Clone the GearPump repository

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/intel-hadoop/gearpump.git
  cd gearpump
  ```

2. Start master

  We support [Master HA](https://github.com/intel-hadoop/gearpump/wiki/Run-Examples#master-ha) and allow master to start on multiple nodes. 

  Build a package, distribute to all nodes, and extract it.

  ```bash
  ## The target package path: target/gearpump-$VERSION.tar.gz
  sbt clean pack-archive
  ```
  
  Modify `conf/gear.conf` and set `gearpump.cluster.masters` to the list of nodes you plan to start master on (e.g. node1).

  ```
  gearpump {
   ...
    cluster {
      masters = ["node1:3000"]
    }
  }
  ```

  Start master on the nodes you set in the conf previously.

  ```bash
  ## on node1
  cd gearpump-$VERSION
  bin/master -ip node1 -port 3000
  ```

3. Start worker

  Start multiple workers on one or more nodes. 
  
  Modify `conf/gear.conf` and make sure `gearpump.cluster.masters` points to the list of masters you started.  (e.g. node1).

  ```
  gearpump {
   ...
    cluster {
      masters = ["node1:3000"]
    }
  }
  ```

  ```bash
  bin/worker
  ```

4. Distribute application jar and run

  Distribute wordcount jar `examples/wordcount/target/pack/lib/gearpump-examples-wordcount-$VERSION.jar` to one of cluster nodes and run with

  ```bash
  ## Run WordCount example
  bin/gear app -jar gearpump-examples-wordcount-$VERSION.jar org.apache.gearpump.streaming.examples.wordcount.WordCount -master node1:3000
  ```
  
  User can change the configuration by providing a "application.conf" in classpath. "application.conf" follows HCON format.

## How to write a GearPump Application

This is what a [GearPump WordCount](https://github.com/intel-hadoop/gearpump/tree/master/examples/wordcount/src/main/scala/org/apache/gearpump/streaming/examples/wordcount) looks like.

  ```scala
  class WordCount extends Starter with ArgumentsParser {

    override def application(config: ParseResult) : AppDescription = {
      val partitioner = new HashPartitioner()
      val split = TaskDescription(classOf[Split].getCanonicalName, splitNum)
      val sum = TaskDescription(classOf[Sum].getCanonicalName, sumNum)
      
      // Here we define the dag
      val dag = Graph(split ~ partitioner ~> sum)
      
      val app = AppDescription("wordCount", classOf[AppMaster].getCanonicalName, appConfig, dag)
      app
    }
  }
  ```
