## How to launch a Gearpump cluster on YARN

1. Upload the `gearpump-{{ site.SCALA_BINARY_VERSION }}-{{ site.GEARPUMP_VERSION }}.zip` to remote HDFS Folder, suggest to put it under `/usr/lib/gearpump/gearpump-{{site.SCALA_BINARY_VERSION}}-{{ site.GEARPUMP_VERSION }}.zip`

2. Make sure the home directory on HDFS is already created and all read-write rights are granted for user. For example, user ```gear```'s home directory is ```/user/gear```

3. Put the YARN configurations under classpath.
  Before calling "yarnclient launch", make sure you have put all yarn configuration files under classpath.
  Typically, you can just copy all files under ```$HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop``` from one of the YARN Cluster machine to ```conf/yarnconf``` of gearpump.
  ```$HADOOP_HOME``` points to the Hadoop installation directory. 

4. Launch the gearpump cluster on YARN

   ```
    yarnclient launch -package /usr/lib/gearpump/gearpump-{{site.SCALA_BINARY_VERSION}}-{{site.GEARPUMP_VERSION}}.zip
   ```

   If you don't specify package path, it will read default package-path (`gearpump.yarn.client.package-path`) from `gear.conf`.

   **NOTE:** You may need to execute `chmod +x bin/*` in shell to make the script file `yarnclient` executable.
   
5. After launching, you can browser the Gearpump UI via YARN resource manager dashboard.

## How to configure the resource limitation of Gearpump cluster

Before launching a Gearpump cluster, please change configuration section ```gearpump.yarn``` in gear.conf to configure the resource limitation, like:

1. The number of worker containers. 
2. The YARN container memory size for worker and master.

## How to submit a application to Gearpump cluster.

To submit the jar to the Gearpump cluster, we first need to know the Master address, so we need to get
a active configuration file first.

There are two ways to get an active configuration file:

1. Option 1: specify "-output" option when you launch the cluster.

   ```
    yarnclient launch -package /usr/lib/gearpump/gearpump-{{site.SCALA_BINARY_VERSION}}-{{site.GEARPUMP_VERSION}}.zip -output /tmp/mycluster.conf
   ```

   It will return in console like this:

   ```
   ================================================
   ==Application Id: application_1449802454214_0034
   ```

2. Option 2: Query the active configuration file

   ```
    yarnclient getconfig -appid <yarn application id> -output /tmp/mycluster.conf
   ```

    yarn application id can be found from the output of step1 or from YARN dashboard.

3. After you downloaded the configuration file, you can launch application with that config file.

   ```
    gear app -jar examples/wordcount-{{site.SCALA_BINARY_VERSION}}-{{site.GEARPUMP_VERSION}}.jar -conf /tmp/mycluster.conf
   ```
  
4. To run Storm application over Gearpump on YARN, please store the configuration file with `-output application.conf` 
   and then launch Storm application with

   ```
    storm -jar examples/storm-{{site.SCALA_BINARY_VERSION}}-{{site.GEARPUMP_VERSION}}.jar storm.starter.ExclamationTopology exclamation
   ```
  
5. Now the application is running. To check this:

   ```
   gear info -conf /tmp/mycluster.conf
   ```

6. To Start a UI server, please do:
   ```
   services -conf /tmp/mycluster.conf
   ```
   The default username and password is "admin:admin", you can check
   [UI Authentication](deployment-ui-authentication.html) to find how to manage users.

   
## How to add/remove machines dynamically.

Gearpump yarn tool allows to dynamically add/remove machines. Here is the steps:

 1. First, query to get active resources.

    ```
    yarnclient query -appid <yarn application id>
    ```

    The console output will shows how many workers and masters there are. For example, I have output like this:

    ```
     masters:
     container_1449802454214_0034_01_000002(IDHV22-01:35712)
     workers:
     container_1449802454214_0034_01_000003(IDHV22-01:35712)
     container_1449802454214_0034_01_000006(IDHV22-01:35712)
    ```

 2. To add a new worker machine, you can do:

    ```
    yarnclient addworker -appid <yarn application id> -count 2
    ```

    This will add two new workers machines. Run the command in first step to check whether the change is effective.

 3. To remove old machines, use:

    ```
    yarnclient removeworker -appid <yarn application id> -container <worker container id>
    ```

    The worker container id can be found from the output of step 1. For example "container_1449802454214_0034_01_000006" is a good container id.

## Other usage:
 1. To kill a cluster,

    ```
    yarnclient kill -appid <yarn application id>
    ```

    **NOTE:** If the application is not launched successfully, then this command won't work. Please use "yarn application -kill <appId>" instead.

 2. To check the Gearpump version

    ```
    yarnclient version -appid <yarn application id>
    ```
