#### Gearpump Serialization

Gearpump has a built-in serialization framework with a shaded Kryo version, which allows you to customize how a specific message type can be serialized. 

##### Register a class before serialization.

Note, to use built-in kryo serialization framework, Gearpump requires all classes to be registered explicitly before using, no matter you want to use a custom serializer or not. If not using custom serializer, Gearpump will use default com.esotericsoftware.kryo.serializers.FieldSerializer to serialize the class. 

To register a class, you need to change the configuration file gear.conf(or application.conf if you want it only take effect for single application).

```
gearpump {
  serializers {
    ## We will use default FieldSerializer to serialize this class type
    "io.gearpump.UserMessage" = ""
    
    ## we will use custom serializer to serialize this class type
    "io.gearpump.UserMessage2" = "io.gearpump.UserMessageSerializer"
  }
}
```

##### How to define a custom serializer for built-in kryo serialization framework

When you decide that you want to define a custom serializer, you can do this in two ways.

Please note that Gearpump shaded the original Kryo dependency. The package name ```com.esotericsoftware``` was relocated to ```io.gearpump.esotericsoftware```. So in the following customization, you should import corresponding shaded classes, the example code will show that part.

###### System Level Serializer

If the serializer is widely used, you can define a global serializer which is avaiable to all applications(or worker or master) in the system.

####### Step1: you first need to develop a java library which contains the custom serializer class. here is an example:

```scala
package io.gearpump

import io.gearpump.esotericsoftware.kryo.{Kryo, Serializer}
import io.gearpump.esotericsoftware.kryo.io.{Input, Output}

class UserMessage(longField: Long, intField: Int)

class UserMessageSerializer extends Serializer[UserMessage] {
  override def write(kryo: Kryo, output: Output, obj: UserMessage) = {
    output.writeLong(obj.longField)
    output.writeInt(obj.intField)
  }

  override def read(kryo: Kryo, input: Input, typ: Class[UserMessage]): UserMessage = {
    val longField = input.readLong()
    val intField = input.readInt()
    new UserMessage(longField, intField)
  }
}
```

####### Step2: Distribute the libraries

Distribute the jar file to lib/ folder of every Gearpump installation in the cluster.

####### Step3: change gear.conf on every machine of the cluster:

```
gearpump {
  serializers {
    "io.gearpump.UserMessage" = "io.gearpump.UserMessageSerializer"
  }
}
```

####### All set!

###### Define Application level custom serializer
If all you want is to define an application level serializer, which is only visible to current application AppMaster and Executors(including tasks), you can follow a different approach.

####### Step1: Define your custom Serializer class

You should include the Serializer class in your application jar. Here is an example to define a custom serializer:

```scala
package io.gearpump

import io.gearpump.esotericsoftware.kryo.{Kryo, Serializer}
import io.gearpump.esotericsoftware.kryo.io.{Input, Output}

class UserMessage(longField: Long, intField: Int)

class UserMessageSerializer extends Serializer[UserMessage] {
  override def write(kryo: Kryo, output: Output, obj: UserMessage) = {
    output.writeLong(obj.longField)
    output.writeInt(obj.intField)
  }

  override def read(kryo: Kryo, input: Input, typ: Class[UserMessage]): UserMessage = {
    val longField = input.readLong()
    val intField = input.readInt()
    new UserMessage(longField, intField)
  }
}
```

####### Step2: Put a application.conf in your classpath on Client machine where you submit the application, 

```
### content of application.conf
gearpump {
  serializers {
    "io.gearpump.UserMessage" = "io.gearpump.UserMessageSerializer"
  }
}
```

####### Step3: All set!


##### Advanced: Choose another serialization framework

Note: This is only for advanced user which require deep customization of Gearpump platform.

There are other serialization framework besides Kryo, like Protobuf. If user don't want to use the built-in kryo serialization framework, he can customize a new serialization framework. 

basically, user need to define in gear.conf(or application.conf for single application's scope) file like this:

```bash
gearpump.serialization-framework = "io.gearpump.serializer.CustomSerializationFramework"
```

Please find an example in gearpump storm module, search "StormSerializationFramework" in source code.
