cgroups (abbreviated from control groups) is a Linux kernel feature to limit, account, and isolate resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.) of process groups.In Gearpump, we use cgroup to manage CPU resources.

## Start CGroup Service 

Cgroups feature is only supported by Linux whose kernel version is larger than 2.6.18. Please also make sure the SELinux is disabled before start CGroup.

The following steps are supposed to be executed by root user.

1. Check /etc/cgconfig.conf exist or not. If not exists, please "yum install libcgroup".

2. Run following command to see whether the **cpu** subsystem is already mounted to the file system.
 
   ```
   lssubsys -m
   ```
   
   Each subsystem in CGroup will have a corresponding mount file path in local file system. For example, the following output shows that **cpu** subsystem is mounted to file path ```/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu```
   
   ```
   cpu /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu
   net_cls /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls
   blkio /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio
   perf_event /sys/fs/cgroup/perf_event
   ```
   
3. If you want to assign permission to user **gear** to launch Gearpump Worker and applications with resouce isolation enabled, you need to check gear's uid and gid in /etc/passwd file, let's take **500** for example.

4. Add following content to /etc/cgconfig.conf
    
   ```
      # The mount point of cpu subsystem.
      # If your system already mounted it, this segment should be eliminated.
      mount {    
        cpu = /cgroup/cpu;
      }
      
      # Here the group name "gearpump" represents a node in CGroup's hierarchy tree.
      # When the CGroup service is started, there will be a folder generated under the mount point of cpu subsystem,
      # whose name is "gearpump".
      
      group gearpump {
         perm {
             task {
                 uid = 500;
                 gid = 500;
              }
             admin {
                 uid = 500;
                 gid = 500;
             }
         }
         cpu {
         }
      }
   ```
   
   Please note that if the output of step 2 shows that **cpu** subsystem is already mounted, then the ```mount``` segment should not be included.
   
4. Then Start cgroup service
   
   ```
   sudo service cgconfig restart 
   ```
   
5. There should be a folder **gearpump** generated under the mount point of cpu subsystem and its owner is **gear:gear**.  
  
6. Repeat the above-mentioned steps on each machine where you want to lauch Gearpump.   

## Enable Cgroups in Gearpump 
1. Login into the machine which has CGroup prepared with user **gear**.

   ```
   ssh gear@node
   ```

2. Enter into Gearpump's home folder, edit gear.conf under folder ```${GEARPUMP_HOME}/conf/```

   ```
   gearpump.worker.executor-process-launcher = "io.gearpump.cluster.worker.CGroupProcessLauncher"
   
   gearpump.cgroup.root = "gearpump"
   ```

   Please note the gearpump.cgroup.root **gearpump** must be consistent with the group name in /etc/cgconfig.conf.

3. Repeat the above-mentioned steps on each machine where you want to lauch Gearpump

4. Start the Gearpump cluster, please refer to [Deploy Gearpump in Standalone Mode](deployment-standalone.html)

## Launch Application From Commad Line
1. Login into the machine which has Gearpump distribution.

2. Enter into Gearpump's home folder, edit gear.conf under folder ```${GEARPUMP_HOME}/conf/```
   
   ```
   gearpump.cgroup.cpu-core-limit-per-executor = ${your_preferred_int_num}
   ```
  
   Here the configuration is the number of CPU cores per executor can use and -1 means no limitation

3. Submit application

   ```
   bin/gear app -jar examples/sol-${version}-assembly.jar -streamProducer 10 -streamProcessor 10 
   ```

4. Then you can run command ```top``` to monitor the cpu usage.

## Launch Application From Dashboard
If you want to submit the application from dashboard, by default the ```gearpump.cgroup.cpu-core-limit-per-executor``` is inherited from Worker's configuration. You can provide your own conf file to override it.

## Limitations
Windows and Mac OS X don't support CGroup, so the resource isolation will not work even if you turn it on. There will not be any limitition for single executor's cpu usage.
