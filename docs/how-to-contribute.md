## Contributions Welcome!
Gearpump is developed by an open and friendly community. Everybody is cordially welcome to join the community and contribute to Gearpump. There are several ways to interact with the community and to contribute to Gearpump including asking questions, filing bug reports, implementing new use cases, proposing new features, joining discussions on the mailing lists, contributing code or documentation, improving the website, or testing release candidates.

### Ask questions!

The Gearpump community is eager to help and to answer your questions. We have a [user mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gearpump-user).

### File a bug report

Please let us know if you experienced a problem with Gearpump and file a bug report. Open [Gearpump’s Issue Tracker](https://github.com/gearpump/gearpump/issues) and click on the green *New Issue* button at the top right. Please give detailed information about the problem you encountered and, if possible, add a description that helps to reproduce the problem. Thank you very much.

### Propose an improvement or a new feature

Our community is constantly looking for feedback to improve Gearpump. If you have an idea how to improve Gearpump or have a new feature in mind that would be beneficial for Gearpump users, please open an issue in [Gearpump’s Issue Tracker](https://github.com/gearpump/gearpump/issues). The improvement or new feature should be described in appropriate detail and include the scope and its requirements if possible. Detailed information is important for a few reasons:

* It ensures your requirements are met when the improvement or feature is implemented.
* It helps to estimate the effort and to design a solution that addresses your needs.
* It allow for constructive discussions that might arise around this issue.
* Detailed information is also required, if you plan to contribute the improvement or feature you proposed yourself. Please read the Contribute code guide in this case as well.

### Test a release candidate

Gearpump is continuously improved by its active community. Every few weeks, we release a new version of Gearpump with bug fixes, improvements, and new features. Release testing is a big effort if done by a small group of people but can be easily scaled out to more people. The Gearpump community encourages everybody to participate in the testing of a release candidate. By testing a release candidate, you can ensure that the next Gearpump release is working properly for your setup and help to improve the quality of releases.

### Contribute code

Gearpump is maintained, improved, and extended by code contributions of volunteers. The Gearpump community encourages anybody to contribute source code.
