We considered Gearpump suitable for your application:

1.  when you are a Scala guru and want to do streaming in Scala, or
2.  when you already use Akka to do streaming, and want more data consistency, performance, and manageability, or
3.  when you have IOT(internet of things) requirements and want to collect data from IOT, or deploy computation to edge devices transparently, or
4.  when you have large in-memory data to maintain and want long running daemons for streaming, or
5.  when you have exactly once message processing requirements but still need low latency, or
6.  when you want to dynamically swap-in/swap-out certain sub-DAGs on a running topology, or
7.  when you require real time streaming with max throughput without worrying about flow control or out of memory error, or
8.  you want to try something new and cool :)
