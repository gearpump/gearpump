 * Partitioner bound to a target Storm component
 *
 * Partitioning is already done in [[io.gearpump.experiments.storm.util.StormOutputCollector]] and
 * kept in "targetPartitions" of [[io.gearpump.experiments.storm.topology.GearpumpTuple]]
 * the partitioner just returns the partitions of the target
 *
 * In Gearpump, a message is sent from a task to all the subscribers.
 * In Storm, however, a message is sent to one or more of the subscribers.
 * Hence, we have to do the partitioning in
 * [[io.gearpump.experiments.storm.util.StormOutputCollector]] till the Storm way is supported
 * in Gearpump
