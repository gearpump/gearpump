 * [[GearpumpMaterializer]] allows you to render akka-stream DSL as a Gearpump
 * streaming application. If some module cannot be rendered remotely in Gearpump
 * Cluster, then it will use local Actor materializer as fallback to materialize
 * the module locally.
 *
 * User can custom a [[Strategy]] to determinie which module should be rendered
 * remotely, and which module should be rendered locally.
 *
 * @see [[GraphCutter]] to find out how we cut the [[ModuleGraph]] to two parts,
 *      and materialize them seperately.
