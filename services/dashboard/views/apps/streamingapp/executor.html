    caption-tooltip="In runtime, every application instance is represented by a single AppMaster and a list of Executors. AppMaster represents the command and controls center of the Application instance. It communicates with user, master, worker, and executor to get the job done. Each executor is a parallel unit for distributed application. Typically AppMaster and Executor will be started as JVM processes on worker nodes."
